Description of the code and BLAST performance 
In this experiment I have given with the sequence no. -5, that I downloaded and copied in my directory at dugong software. While giving the commands to run the BLAST at various counts, various results are recorded.
The code provided in myscript . sh repository consist details of sample sequence on which blast is performed. For the interpretation of results a curve can be plotted between the value of Counts and frequencies of mismatches according to the information that I had submitted in the tabular form.
Firstly, I run the blast on sequence with the count 100 that shows no mis-match frequency in its results, again the blast is performed on 200,300,400,500,600 and 700 count that shows not any variation in the frequency of mis-matches and the fraction of true matches remains 100% up to count 700.
Moving further, when the count increased to 800 the that represented 90% fraction of true matches. Again, the blast performance at limit 900 denotes 70% fraction of mismatches. It denotes that the curve of true matches moving in downward direction. 
Then, I run the sequence at limit 1000 that brought same results as per limit 900 performance that denotes the curve can be stable at these limits.
In the next step the BLAST is run on count 1100 that gives nine mismatches and just one true match that shows the frequency curve of true matches slope down as the frequency of mismatches incremented highly.
The exceptional result is shown at Count 1200 which opposes the whole sequence results by showing its dis-similarity with previous outcomes. Furthermore, the Blast is run on sequence with the limit 1300 that denotes 100% fraction of mismatches.
Again, the blast performed on various counts like 1600,1700,1800,1900 at many times but there is no true match in the outcomes. So, the limits of Blast can be determined by run the sequence at various counts.
